**In this repo you see my first experience with redux (react-redux)**
Redux is a state-management library which makes it easier to organize
your state and in turn making specifically big projects more manageable.
The downside is you need to do some initial setups which would be
good amount of work.
In addition to the main project (which is a guided project) I have added
test units to all major components.
